## Exctutive Summary
Our key findings from the research study stemmed from five categories (consumer insights, app interface, price, promotion, and safety/security). We found that the accuracy of post descriptions, lack of effective communication with the host,overpricing of properties, lack of discounts, frequency of scams, cleanliness and safety in the property were the major issues leading to the decline in popularity of Airbnb among the target market.
## Research Objectives
The main objective of our survey was to gain consumer insights and decide whether to continue or improve different aspects of the Airbnb app such as pricing, promotions, safety / security, and the app interface. We want to gauge customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the Airbnb platform following the epidemic and offer workable ideas and marketing tactics to help the company reclaim its former brand quality.

##Recommendations
We came up with three main recommendations that address Airbnbâ€™s issues with customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and brand perception.

###1. Partnering with credit card companies:
We found that if customers were able to earn reward points by using their credit card on Airbnb, they would book more often on the platform. We recommend the company partner with well-known credit card issuers (such as Mastercard, Visa, Chase etc.) and offer a rewards program where users can accrue points
and get money back on Airbnb reservations.

###2. Making more trustworthy posts:
Our findings made it clear that customers had expectations that were not met regarding the property photos and descriptions provided on Airbnb. In order to create more trustworthy property posts, Airbnb should take the initiative to monitor whether property hosts are consistently posting accurate photos which also match their descriptions. This also includes monitoring customer feedback on all properties to ensure that users are not misled by inaccurate or fake posts.
Encouraging hosts to post high quality photos or upload 3D virtual tours of their properties might instill more trust in the information provided on the platform.

3. Offering a superior experience:
We advise Airbnb to enforce stricter rules for property hosts. If they are caught not following the safety protocols in their properties, posting false information and fake photos, blocking CCTV cameras or attempting to scam customers, they will be immediately banned from the platform.
If property hosts are looking to post a listing on Airbnb, they should be encouraged to set up CCTV cameras outside their property for the protection of their guests. If this is not feasible for any reason, another solution should be found to assure customer security at the property.
Additionally, we recommend that Airbnb give greater importance to protecting customer information by strengthening their cyber security department and investing money into establishing encrypted channels that will reduce scamming attempts
